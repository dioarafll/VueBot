## Best Practices for a Professional Chatbot üí°

- **Message Queueing**: For a professional chatbot, it‚Äôs essential to implement asynchronous message handling, where bot messages are displayed one at a time to the user. This can be achieved with Vue‚Äôs reactive features to control when each message appears.
  
- **Typing Indicators**: A typing indicator is a useful feature in a chatbot to show users that the bot is preparing a reply. This can be implemented using Vue state management and reactive data updates.

- **Error Handling**: Always implement error handling for API calls or asynchronous actions, such as fetching responses from the backend or third-party APIs.

- **Authentication**: Ensure that sensitive routes like `/chat` require proper authentication, especially when handling user messages securely.
